This layer is to demonstrate the effect of TSS.

The commands to test are as below:

bitbake tss-b -c cleansstate \
&& bitbake tss-b \
&& cat tmp/work/core2-64-poky-linux/tss-b/1.0-r0/image/usr/share/from-tss-B.txt

If we disable TSS (echo 'USE_TSS = "0"' >> conf/local.conf), then
we get undeterministic results from the above commands.

If we enable TSS (USE_TSS is already set to "1" in bitbake.conf), then
we get deterministic results from the above commands.
